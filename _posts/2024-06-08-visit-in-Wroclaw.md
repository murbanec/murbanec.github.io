I have just returned from the visit in Wroclaw. I spent three days in the group of [Tobias Fischer](http://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl/~fischer/). 

We discussed the topics related to neutron stars, hot matter, mergers and other things related to common projects. I enjoyed Wroclaw a lot thanks to the kindness of the people. I also teached a course on [Modern Trends in Astrophysics](https://murbanec.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/06/07/Modern-trends.html). I hope that wasn't my last visit (and not the last barbecue we had together).
